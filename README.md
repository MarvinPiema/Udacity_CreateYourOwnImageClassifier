# Udacity_CreateYourOwnImageClassifier
The project has two parts. This first part of the project regards the implementation of an image classifier with PyTorch. The second part consists in building a command line application to make prediction on flowers dataset.

**Project**      
In this project, a code is first developped for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then it is converted into a command line application.

In order to complete this project, the GPU is enabled in workspaces within the classroom. 

You should also only enable the GPU when you need it. Disable the GPU when it is not needed.

**Data**           
The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large you cannot upload it onto Github. If you would like the data for this project, you will want download it from the workspace in the classroom. Though actually completing the project is likely not possible on your local unless you have a GPU. You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
